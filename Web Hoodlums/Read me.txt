WE COULDN'T SET UP A LIVE GITHUB LINK FOR OUR PROJECT DUE TO ITS COMPLEXITY AND TIME CONSTRAINTS. OUR TEAM WORKED HARD ON A SOPHISTICATED WEBSITE WITH A COMPLEX BACKEND. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE. EVEN WITHOUT A LIVE LINK, OUR PROJECT IS WELL-DOCUMENTED IN THE REPOSITORY, AND THE SOURCE CODE IS NEATLY ORGANIZED. IF YOU NEED MORE INFO OR HAVE QUESTIONS, WE'RE HERE TO HELP DURING THE EVALUATION. THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING, AND WE'RE EAGER TO DISCUSS OUR PROJECT FURTHER.
